# PUI 2018 HW 2

**On NYU classes please turn in your github account name where the repositories you will create in this and the following homework sets will be hosted.**

Finish the lab started in the first lab session:
https://github.com/fedhere/PUI2018_fb55/Lab1_fb55


If you were able to follow along you should have a repository set up on your local machine as well as on your github account named gittest_\<yourname\>, with a single file in it named myfirstfle.txt, and you should have a resolved merge conflict. Because your repo is public we can access it, and see the history of your file, and the conflict in it. If you fell behind, please take yourself to this point, and feel free to work with others, but remember that it is your responsibility to learn and be able to reproduce by yourself the work that you do in groups.

**Text Editors.**

-m

remember to add the -m “my commit message” when you commit to github, otherwise github will automatically open a text editor for you to type your message in , and then you have to deal with it. If github opened a text editor it is either emacs or vi, depending on your setup. If you are using emacs or vi, either because github opened them or to edit files, this is how you save your work and exit:


*emacs* 

Save: Ctrl+x Ctrl+s

Exit: Ctrl+x Ctrl+c

(if your emacs is running on the terminal you have to use these shortcuts, if it is running in its own X window you can use the dropdown menu)


*vi*

Save: esc :w

Exit: esc :q
